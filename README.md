## Upcoming Features
**1. Framework Integration**
Currently, this website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The next step is to enhance the project by learning and integrating a JavaScript framework, such as React.js, Vue.js, or Angular. This will allow for more dynamic content rendering and better state management, improving the overall user experience.

**2. Checkout Feature**
The checkout feature is still under development. Once completed, it will allow users to seamlessly purchase items from the pet shop. The feature will include a cart system, payment gateway integration, and order confirmation.

**3. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
To streamline the development process, I plan to learn and implement CI/CD pipelines. This will automate testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring that updates to the website are delivered efficiently and reliably.
